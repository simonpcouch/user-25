Source code and slides for "Small boosts, here and there" at useR! 2025. The talk centers on chores, an R package that helps you with repetitive but hard-to-automate tasks using LLMs. 

Some resources:

* [chores package website](https://simonpcouch.github.io/chores/): Documentation and such.
* [Posit Blog: Introducing chores](https://posit.co/blog/introducing-chores/): A blog post that this talk is based off of.
* [choreseval](https://simonpcouch.github.io/choreseval/): An LLM evaluation I'm using to help identify low-cost / free models that could power chores just as well as Claude Sonnet 4 and friends.
